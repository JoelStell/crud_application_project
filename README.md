# Name of Your App

This program is a CRUD application which will help store managers keep track of their inventory of products. CRUD is an acronym for "Create", "Read", "Update", and "Destroy". These operations represent the primary actions performed on database resources (i.e. records) within an information system. The "Read" operation comprises two operations: the "List" operation for reading all resources, as well as the "Show" operation for reading a single resource.
